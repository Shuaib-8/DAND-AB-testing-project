### Project Title
**Analyze A/B Test Results**

### Description

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
For this project, the objective is to understand the results of an A/B test run by a an e-commerce (fictional) website.
Under such context, the company has developed a new web page to try and increase the number of users who **'convert'** i.e. the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Using various statistical tests and applied modelling (logistical regression), I will look to conclude whether or not the e-commerce website should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

```The stated hypotheses:```

```
$$H_{0} : p_{new} - p_{old} â‰¤ 0$$

$$H_{1} : p_{new} - p_{old} > 0$$
```

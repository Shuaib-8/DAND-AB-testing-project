### Project Title
**Analyze A/B Test Results**

### Description

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
For this project, the objective is to understand the results of an A/B test run by a an e-commerce (fictional) website.
<br>
Under such context, the company has developed a new web page to try and increase the number of users who **'convert'** i.e. the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.
<br>
Using various statistical tests and applied modelling (logistical regression), I will look to conclude whether or not the e-commerce website should implement this new page (Alternative), keep the old page (Null), or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**Null hypothesis:** there is *no difference* between the new and old page in terms of the proportion of click through rates

**Alternative hypothesis:** there is a *difference* between the new and old page in terms of the proportion of click through rates
